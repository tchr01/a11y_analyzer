## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key (for AI-powered PRD generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd a11y-audit-pro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Claude API key**
   - Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   - Or edit `proxy-server.js` and replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual API key

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the app**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Important Notes
- **Don't open the HTML file directly** - you must use the server (`npm start`)
- The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default
- Make sure the target URL is publicly accessible (no authentication required)

## üìñ Usage

1. **Enter a URL**: Input any publicly accessible website URL
2. **Generate Report**: Click "Generate Accessibility Report" and wait for analysis
3. **Review Results**: Navigate through sections using the quick navigation menu
4. **Export Content**: Use the "üìã Copy Section" buttons to export formatted content
5. **Take Action**: Use the triage plan and PRD requirements for implementation

### Export Capabilities
Each section can be exported with rich formatting to:
- **Google Slides/Docs**: Full formatting preserved
- **PowerPoint**: Headers, lists, and emphasis maintained
- **Jira/Confluence**: Structured content with proper hierarchy
- **Slack/Teams**: Clean formatting for messaging
- **Email clients**: Professional appearance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (`proxy-server.js`)
- **Express.js server** with CORS handling
- **Puppeteer** for web scraping and page analysis
- **axe-core integration** for accessibility scanning
- **Cross-origin handling** to bypass browser restrictions

### Frontend (`script.js`)
- **Real-time axe-core processing** into structured reports
- **Dynamic PRD generation** based on actual violations
- **WCAG level mapping** and priority assessment
- **Rich text export** with dual HTML/plain text formats
- **Responsive design** with modern UI components

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch" errors:**
- Ensure you're accessing via `http://localhost:3000`, not opening the HTML file directly
- Check that the server is running (`npm start`)
- Verify the target URL is publicly accessible

**Empty or broken reports:**
- Try a different URL (some sites block automated scanning)
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Puppeteer installation issues:**
- Run `npm install puppeteer --force` if installation fails
- On Linux, you may need additional dependencies for Chromium
