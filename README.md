## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key (for AI-powered PRD generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd a11y-audit-pro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Edit `.env` and add your API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Development

4. **Start development with Vite (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Start both the API server and Vite dev server
   npm run dev:full
   ```
   - API server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

   **OR**

   **Start development servers separately**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the API server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Start the Vite dev server
   npm run dev:vite
   ```

   **OR**

   **Legacy development (single server)**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Production

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Serve production build**
   ```bash
   # Build and serve with preview
   npm run serve
   
   # OR build and serve with production server
   npm run build
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

### Important Notes
- **Use Vite dev server for development** - provides hot reloading and better DX
- **Don't open HTML files directly** - must use a server
- **API server must be running** - handles accessibility analysis and AI generation
- **Target URLs must be publicly accessible** - no authentication required

## üìñ Usage

1. **Enter a URL**: Input any publicly accessible website URL
2. **Generate Report**: Click "Generate Accessibility Report" and wait for analysis
3. **Review Results**: Navigate through sections using the quick navigation menu
4. **Export Content**: Use the "üìã Copy Section" buttons to export formatted content
5. **Take Action**: Use the triage plan and PRD requirements for implementation

### Export Capabilities
Each section can be exported with rich formatting to:
- **Google Slides/Docs**: Full formatting preserved
- **PowerPoint**: Headers, lists, and emphasis maintained
- **Jira/Confluence**: Structured content with proper hierarchy
- **Slack/Teams**: Clean formatting for messaging
- **Email clients**: Professional appearance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (`proxy-server.js`)
- **Express.js server** with CORS handling
- **Puppeteer** for web scraping and page analysis
- **axe-core integration** for accessibility scanning
- **Cross-origin handling** to bypass browser restrictions

### Frontend (`script.js`)
- **Real-time axe-core processing** into structured reports
- **Dynamic PRD generation** based on actual violations
- **WCAG level mapping** and priority assessment
- **Rich text export** with dual HTML/plain text formats
- **Responsive design** with modern UI components

### Dependencies

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start API server with nodemon
npm run dev:vite         # Start Vite dev server
npm run dev:full         # Start both API server and Vite dev server

# Production
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run preview          # Preview production build
npm run serve            # Build and serve production

# Legacy
npm start                # Start API server only
```

### Development Workflow

**With Vite (Recommended):**
```bash
# Start both servers
npm run dev:full

# Access at http://localhost:5173
# API at http://localhost:3000
```

**Traditional:**
```bash
# Start API server only
npm start

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch" errors:**
- Ensure you're accessing via `http://localhost:3000`, not opening the HTML file directly
- Check that the server is running (`npm start`)
- Verify the target URL is publicly accessible

**Empty or broken reports:**
- Try a different URL (some sites block automated scanning)
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Puppeteer installation issues:**
- Run `npm install puppeteer --force` if installation fails
- On Linux, you may need additional dependencies for Chromium

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Try testing with simple sites like `https://example.com`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility (v14+)
